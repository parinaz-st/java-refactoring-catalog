# Java Refactoring Catalog

A structured, teaching-oriented catalog of refactoring techniques implemented in Java.

This repository is inspired by Martin Fowler’s *Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code (2nd Edition)* and reimplements selected refactoring examples in Java.

---

<!--## Purpose

This project serves three primary goals:

1. **Mastery** – Deeply understand and practice core refactoring techniques.
2. **Teaching Preparation** – Provide clean, before/after examples suitable for use in a Software Refactoring course.
3. **Documentation of Process** – Demonstrate incremental refactoring supported by automated tests and small, safe steps.

This repository is not affiliated with the original publisher.  
All refactoring concepts originate from Martin Fowler’s book.  
All Java implementations, structure, and documentation are original work.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each refactoring technique follows a consistent structure:
```text
src/
├── main/
│   └── java/
│       └── com/example/
│           └── refactoring_method/
│               ├── before/
│               └── after/
│
└── test/
    └── java/
        └── com/example/
            └── refactoring_method/
                ├── before/
                └── after/
```
